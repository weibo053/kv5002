## Introduction

The exercises this week are pencil-and-paper exercises designed to improve your
understanding of some practical topics that arise in the network layer.
In particular, you will work on designing IP addressing schemes for given
network scenarios, and on demonstrating an understanding of the key control
plane algorithms for intra-AS routing: link-state and distance-vector.

## Exercises

The exercises are available from [network layer exercises]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/network_layer_exercises.pdf).
You might find it helpful to refer to [this Cisco guide]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/ipaddressing.pdf) to IP addressing.
