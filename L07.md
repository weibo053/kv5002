These exercises introduce the main concepts and Unix API for working with TCP
socket connections.

The system and API are well documented relevant manual pages are

* `ip(7)` for an overview of the IPv4 implementation
* `ipv6(7)` for an overview of the IPv6 implementation
* `socket(7)` for the socket interface

The functions that we'll use are documented in 

* `getaddrinfo(3)`
* `socket(2)`
* `connect(2)`
* `bind(2)`
* `listen(2)`
* `accept(2)`
* `send(2)`
* `recv(2)`

Error reporting is covered in

* `errno(3)`
* `perror(3)`
* `strerror(3)`

## Host look up
The `getaddrinfo(3)` function is the principle way for looking up IP addresses
and port numbers for defined services (see `services(5)`and
[IANA registered port numbers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)).

The returned address is in the `struct sockaddr *ai_addr;` field of the
`struct addrinfo` structure returned in the results.  

### IPv4
For IPv4 addresses this is a pointer to a `struct sockaddr_in` structure:

```c
  struct sockaddr_in {
      sa_family_t    sin_family; /* address family: AF_INET */
      in_port_t      sin_port;   /* port in network byte order */
      struct in_addr sin_addr;   /* internet address */
  };

  /* Internet address. */
  struct in_addr {
      uint32_t       s_addr;     /* address in network byte order */
  };
```

### IPv6
For IPv6 addresses this is a pointer to a `struct sockaddr_on6` structure:

```c
  struct sockaddr_in6 {
      sa_family_t     sin6_family;   /* AF_INET6 */
      in_port_t       sin6_port;     /* port number */
      uint32_t        sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information */
      struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     /* IPv6 address */
      uint32_t        sin6_scope_id; /* Scope ID (new in 2.4) */
  };

  struct in6_addr {
      unsigned char   s6_addr[16];   /* IPv6 address */
  };
```

### Exercise
Clone the [repository](https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/kv5002_L07.1) and `cd`
into the directory

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/kv5002_L07.1.git
$ cd kv5002_L07.1
```

Compile the program
```shell-session
$ cc -o hostinfo hostinfo.c
```
Try the program with some hosts and services
```shell-session
$ ./hostinfo google.com https
$ ./hostinfo hesabu.net http
```

1. Modify the program to print out the port number for each returned
   `sockaddr`.  
    _hints_
    * Check the value of `results->ai_family` with an `if` or `switch`
    * Cast the pointer `results->ai_addr` into a pointer to the appropriate
      `sockaddr` structure (see above)
    * use the value of the `sin_port` or `sin6_port` as appropriate.
    * don't forget to use `ntohs` to convert the number.
2. Study the code with the help of the man-pages.  Make sure you follow the
   logic, and the data-structures and pointers.

## HTTP Header
Clone the [repository](https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/kv5002_L07.2) and `cd`
into the directory.

Compile and run the program
```shell-session
cc -o httphead httphead.c
```

Try the program with a few web servers.

### Exercises
1. Examine the program and make sure you understand each step and it's error
   handling.
2. Is there a way of tidying up the error checking.  (I find that I can't see
   the logic for the error handling).  
   _hist_ write a function that can be called in place of each `if` block that
   handles an error
3. Add some logic to look at the line from the header (at about line 86 in the
   code).
   * handle the HTTP response line (the first line of the header) differently.
   * add a filter that prints header lines of interest, those with certain key
     values.

# Chat Client and Server
You should be able to write a simple server and client that send messages to
each other.  This is tricky so don't expect to get it all at once.

Some points to consider:
 * The `recv` function blocks if there is no message, does it need it's own
   thread to act in?
 * Is the chat protocol synchronous, messages alternate between server and
   client (The simpler option).
 * Is the protocol asynchronous, messages can happen in any order?  This is a
   lot harder to program as it relies on separate threads for sending and
   receiving.
 * There are lots of pointers to buffers and various structures using in
   setting up and managing the sockets,  it's easy to get lost.
 * There will be multiple threads.  Where is data shared?  What kind of
   synchronisation, semaphores, and mutexes are needed?
