# Introduction

This lab looks at how to use the POSIX threads API to create and
destroy threads, to reclaim thread resources, and to discover thread
identities and termination statuses. You will
practice:
* how to write `main.c` to create threads and execute them
* how to pass an argument to a thread function
* how to identify a thread
* how to terminate a thread
* how to discover the termination status of a thread
* how to suspend threads by using delays

You will also begin to learn how to use version control software to manage
the software development process. The version control software that we
will use is [git](https://git-scm.com/).

# In the lab

1. If you haven't used `git` before you should start by following the
15 minute tutorial at [Try git](https://try.github.io). If you decide
that you would to sign up for a `github` account of your own, then
you should have a look at the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).


1. Clone the `git` repository for this lab by executing the following
command in the command terminal:

   ``` shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/DavidKendall/kv5002_L04
   ```
Build and run the program as follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ cd kv5002_L04
   $ gcc -o threadexample -pthread threadexample.c
   $ ./threadexample
   ```
Carefully observe the output of the program. Explain each part of the output:
what it is and how it has been obtained. Identify where the output of this
program is different from the output of the very similar `fork` example
program. Look carefully at `threadexample.c` and answer the following questions:

    1. Which function is used to create the new thread?
    1. How many parameters are there to this function?
What does each of them do? Make sure that you can answer this in
detail. Use the `man` page if necessary.
    1. Which function is used by the thread to discover its own thread
identifier?
    1. Which function is used by the thread to exit and begin termination of
the thread?
    1. Which function is used by the main program to wait for the termination
of `simple_thr`. How does the function call indicate that the main program
is not interested in the termination status of the thread?

1. Now modify `threadexample.c` so that the main program passes the argument
   `42` to `simple_thr`, which multiplies by 2 whatever argument it has been
   passed and returns that value as its termination status. The main program
   should retrieve this termination status and print it. You'll need to declare
   a local variable in `main` to hold the termination status. Use `man` to help
   figure out the type of the values that are required here.  This is an
   exercise in the use of pointers and type casts. If you need help with these
   aspects of C programming, ask your lab tutor.

1. Now checkout `P04` as follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ git checkout P04
   ```
This will give you an updated project directory. Again, the main program is
in `threadexample.c`. The main program creates a simple thread to flash an
LED on a console once every second. We will use this console for many of
our forthcoming experiments and exercises. Build and run the program as
follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -c console.c
   $ gcc -o threadexample -pthread threadexample.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./threadexample
   ```
Notice that we need to link the `console` program and the `ncursesw` library
with our code to obtain a working program.
If `gcc` gives messages about missing header or library files
then you may not have the ncurses library installed

   ``` shell_session
   $ sudo apt install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
   $ sudo apt install libncursesw5 libncursesw5-dev
   ```
Identify the parts of the
command line above that do that for us. Run and observe the behaviour of the
program. You should look at the `man` page for the `console` program,
using the command

   ``` shell_session
   $ groff -man -Tutf8 console.3 | less
   ```
It is a simple console that emulates 4 LEDs (WHITE, RED, GREEN, and BLUE)
and a small LCD for writing text. The `man` page describes the functions
that are provided by the `console` program. Study the code carefully in
`threadexample.c`. You should understand how the main program creates a
new thread to flash the WHITE LED at a rate of 1 Hz (i.e. once per second).
It uses the `usleep()` function to generate the correct time delay. Look
at the `man` page for `usleep` to see how it can be used.

1. Now modify `threadexample.c` to create another thread, `led_toggle_red_thr`,
that flashes the RED LED at 2 Hz. Build and run your program, using what you
know from the previous exercise.

1. Now modify `threadexample.c` again to create two more threads, `led_toggle_green_thr`
and `led_toggle_blue_thr` that flash the GREEN and the BLUE LEDs at 4 Hz and 8 Hz,
respectively. Build and run your program. You should now have all 4 LEDs flashing
at different rates. If you notice that your program produces a nasty mess in the
LEDs section of the console, you have just been the victim of a *race condition*.
We'll discuss this more next week. For now, you can fix the problem by linking
your program with the *thread-safe* version of the `console` program, as
follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -c console_safe.c
   $ gcc -o threadexample -pthread threadexample.c console_safe.c -l ncursesw
   $ ./threadexample
   ```
This should fix the problem. We'll find out how and why in the next week or
two.

1. Now modify `threadexample.c` so that it uses a single thread declaration
`led_toggle_thr` and creates four separate instances of this thread, one
for each of the LEDs. You should pass the identifier of the LED that each
thread instance should flash as an argument in the call to
`pthread_create`, used to create the thread instances. For now, you can allow
all the LEDs to flash at the same rate, e.g. 1 Hz. Use an array of `thread_t`
and a loop to create the four thread instances.

1. Modify `threadexample.c` again so that each thread instance created in the
previous exercise is passed both the identifier of the LED to be flashed
*and* the rate at which the flashing should occur as an argument in the
call to `pthread_create`. Use this mechanism to create a program that flashes
the LEDs as follows: LED_WHITE @ 1 Hz; LED_RED @ 2 Hz; LED_GREEN @ 4 Hz and
LED_BLUE @ 8 Hz.

1. A further example of thread use can be found at

   ``` shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/dr-alun-moon/posix-threads-examples
   ```
Creating a mandelbrot set is a good candidate for multi-threading. Each pixel
(or group of pixels) can be calculated independently of the others. This also
shows what you can do with the right command line tools such as
[Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/).
