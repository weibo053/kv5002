# Introduction

This lab looks at the problems that can arise when tasks share
resources. The problems are tackled by using semaphores. The lab requires the
use of semaphores for both mutual exclusion and synchronisation.

# In the lab

1. Make sure that you understand the solution to last week's exercises. Ask
   your lab tutor for help if you have any questions.

1. Clone the `git` repository for this lab by executing the following command
   at the command terminal:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/kv5002_L05
   $ cd kv5002_L05
   ```
   Build and run the `count_unprotected` program as follows:

   ```sh
   $ gcc -Wall -c console_safe.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o count_unprotected -pthread count_unprotected.c console_safe.o -lncursesw
   $ ./count_unprotected
   ```
   Run the program 10 times. Observe its behaviour. What do you notice? Is the program behaving as you
   would expect? If not, describe the problem. What do you think is
   causing the behaviour that you see?

1. Now checkout `P03`.  Build and run the program as follows:

   ```sh 
   $ git checkout P03
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o count_semaphore -pthread count_semaphore.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./count_semaphore
   ``` 
   Observe its behaviour. Study the code. In particular, you should pay attention to:
   * the inclusion of `pthread.h` and `semaphore.h`
   * the declaration of the semaphore `static sem_t sem;`
   * the use of `sem_init` to initialise the semaphore
   * the use of `sem_wait` to acquire the semaphore
   * the use of `sem_post` to release the semaphore

   Notice how this program solves the interference problem that you observed
   when running `count_unprotected`. We could use
   Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm to solve this problem but this
   program does not have the busy waiting problem of Peterson's algorithm. 
   When a task is blocked, waiting for a semaphore, some other task gets
   a chance to run. This leads to much more efficient use of the CPU.

   **Note** If the `count_semaphore` program does not terminate when you press
   `Ctrl-C`, use the process control commands that you learned in week 3 to 
   stop it. You may also need to use the `clear` and/or `reset` commands to get
   your terminal window back into a 'normal' state.

1. You may notice when you run the `count_semaphore` program that one of the
   `count` threads usually runs slightly ahead of the other `count` thread. How
   is this possible? Is this an error? Explain your answer. Modify the
   `count_semaphore.c` program so that both `count` threads make progress at
   the same rate (HINT: use 2 semaphores for signalling, instead of the mutual
   exclusion semaphore, and pay careful attention to the initialisation of
   their counters - see slides 12 and 13 in Lecture 05-2 if you need
   further help). How confident are you that mutual exclusion is preserved?

1. Checkout `P05` which is the starting program for the next couple of
   exercises in this session. Build and run the program as follows:

   ```sh
   $ git checkout P05
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o leds -pthread leds.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./leds
   ```
   You'll see that it is another program to flash some LEDS: LED_WHITE and
   LED_RED. Initially the lights are off. You can start flashing LED_WHITE by
   pressing the left arrow key. Similarly, you can start flashing LED_RED by
   pressing the right arrow key. Actually, left arrow and right arrow act as
   toggle switches: turn on if off; turn off if on. You can also adjust the
   rate at which the lights flash. Up arrow / Down arrow to increase / decrease
   the rate of LED_WHITE and Pg Up / Pg Dn to increase / decrease the rate of
   LED_RED.  Experiment with program and study the code carefully until you
   understand how it works. Ask your lab tutor if you need some help.

1. Now modify your program so that each of the LED threads reports its own
   status using the LCD. The thread should report whether or not it is flashing
   and its current flashing delay, e.g.

   ```
   (LED1) F:ON  D:900000
   (LED2) F:OFF D:1500000
   ```

1. Experiment with the flashing delays of each of the LEDs. Do you observe any
   interference between the LED threads when they are using the LCD? Why does
   this occur?  Remember the LCD is now a shared resource. Use a semaphore to
   provide mutually exclusive access to the LCD, so that the interference is
   prevented. Comment on the effectiveness of your solution. Once you have this
   working, take a close look at the code in `console_safe.c`. It should be
   clear now how the console operations have been made thread-safe. If you need
   further explanation, ask your lab tutor.

1. Now checkout P07 and build and run the program by
   executing the following commands:

   ```sh
   $ git checkout P07
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o leds -pthread leds.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./leds
   ```
   Observe its behaviour. This is a solution to the previous exercise.
   Study the code. In particular, you should pay attention to:
    * the declaration of the semaphore  `sem_t lcd_sem`
    * the use of `sem_init` to initialise the semaphore
    * the use of `sem_wait` to acquire the semaphore
    * the use of `sem_post` to release the semaphore

   Note how `lcd_sem` is used by the LED threads to ensure mutually exclusive
   access to the LCD. Identify the *entry protocol* and the *exit protocol* for
   the critical section in each of these threads.

1. Now checkout `P09`. Build and run the program as follows:

   ```sh
   $ git checkout P09
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o lcd -pthread lcd_with_interference.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./lcd
   ```
   You'll see a nasty mess in your console window. You can stop the program
   by typing `Ctrl-C` and you can repair the terminal window, if necessary,
   using the `reset` command. Next try building the program with `console_safe.o`,
   as follows:

   ```sh
   $ gcc -Wall -c console_safe.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o lcd -pthread lcd_with_interference.c console_safe.o -lncursesw
   $ ./lcd
   ```
   This time you'll see how the program is intended to run. It creates three
   threads, each of which increments its own local counter, and prints the
   value of the counter to the LCD. The LCD is a resource that is shared by all
   three threads. As you have seen, the threads can interfere with each other
   when using the LCD, unless precautions are taken to prevent it. The
   `console_safe.c` program uses semaphores to prevent interference. An alternative
   approach is to use a mutual exclusion semaphore inside `lcd.c`. Implement this
   approach instead, based on what you have learned from studying the 
   program in `P07`. Build and run your new program as follows:

   ```sh
   $ gcc -Wall -o lcd -pthread lcd_with_interference.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./lcd
   ```
   You should find that the program behaves properly without interference.

1. Rather than allowing all threads to write to the LCD and controlling their
   use of the resource by having them all follow the mutual exclusion protocol,
   it can be better to have a single thread (an LCD thread) that is the only
   thread permitted to write to the LCD. Any other threads have only indirect
   access to the LCD by sending a message containing their data to the LCD
   thread, which is then responsible for displaying an appropriate message. The
   exchange of data between the LCD thread and other threads can be managed by
   using a *ring buffer*. Modify your program so that it is implemented in this
   way. You'll need to do the following:

   1. Add an LCD thread to be responsible for managing the display.

   1. Add new files `buffer.h` and `buffer.c` to the project.  Implement the
      naive circular buffer that was described in [lecture
      05-2]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/05-2.pdf).  Modify the definition of
      the message type, `message_t`, so that it is suitable for use in this
      application.  You need fields in the structure to identify the thread
      sending the message and to store the other data that is being sent.

   1. The naive buffer has a number of potential problems: interference between
      multiple producers or consumers; failure if a producer attempts to put to
      a full buffer; and failure if a consumer attempts to get from an empty
      buffer. Now implement 3 new functions, `safe_buffer_init()`,
      `safe_buffer_put()` and `safe_buffer_get()` to provide a solution to
      these problems, as described in [lecture
      05-2]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/05-2.pdf) from the slide *Elements
      of a solution* onwards. You'll need to decide on appropriate parameters
      for these functions yourself. Use your naive buffer functions to
      implement the operations to add and remove items from the buffer. Modify
      your `buffer.h` and `buffer.c` files accordingly.

   1. Now modify your main program by:
   * removing all synchronisation code - use of semaphores etc.
   * modify your `count` threads so that, instead of writing to the LCD, they send
     messages to the LCD thread reporting their `id` and `counter` value.  The job
     of the LCD thread is to read these messages and update the LCD accordingly.
     You should use your `safe_buffer` implementation for passing messages between
     threads.

   Ask your lab tutor for help in interpreting these instructions and
   for guidance about your implementation.
